**Sol-Cool: The internets carbon removing standard.**

**About the Project:**
Introducing 'SPL-Cool', a pioneering carbon-removing initiative deployed on the Solana blockchain. 'SPL-Cool' brings real-world, perpetual carbon removal into the NFT ecosystem.
By simply setting the royalty of your NFT to the designated SPL-Cool account, you can seamlessly transform your digital assets into effective tools against climate change. With 'SPL-Cool',
the things we love in the NFT space can become verifiable climate action, making every transaction a step towards a greener future. 

**The Motivation of SPL-Cool:**
At Tres Cool, we aim to revolutionize climate action and make it accessible, enjoyable, and cool-enhancing for everyone. We want to create carbon removal and positive action that's a vibe. With SPL-Cool, we make it possible for any NFT to become a planet-cooling, sustainable digital public good. It's time to turn the things we love into icons for change. SPL-Cool is designed to set an entirely new standard for collective climate action, accessible to every corner of the internet.

**How It Works:**
SPL-Cool is made to cool through a deployed smart contract on the Solana blockchain. By setting the royalty of your NFT to the designated SPL-Cool PDA (Program Derived Address) created by our delegate smart contract, funds flow through this account. As funds accumulate, they are directed to purchase high-quality, permanent carbon removal credits. The carbon is removed from our atmosphere and retired upon maturity. The removal impact is tokenized as Cool Factor (FKTR), where 1 FKTR = 1 KG of Carbon Removed. FKTR is made redeemable to the token holder to act as a feedback loop, allowing for individual impact tracking down to the gram, and to introduce a new form of internet status, backed by positive impact.

**This is not offsetting:**
SPL-Cool is a tool for real, permanent carbon removal, not a shortcut to carbon neutrality. While the best solution to planet-warming is not emitting carbon. The next best thing is to take action and remove the carbon that we do emit. And we mean remove. Not offset.

The SPL-Cool is not designed as a race to buy as many carbon credits as possible to fulfill carbon offsetting claims. The SPL-Cool is designed to remove carbon permanently, while providing early funding to scale tech-based carbon removal solutions. The SPL-Cool is a push for beyond status quo, beyond offsetting - to spark a carbon removal revolution, change the way we act and make sure the world has the solutions needed to cool our planet.
